## 📝 Reflection

### 🛠️ Tools & Components
Through this lab session, I learned about the **tools** used in PC assembly and the role each tool plays. I also learned about the **internal components** of a PC and the step-by-step process of building one. I realised that every component has an important function; if even one is missing or fitted incorrectly, the computer can have problems when running.

### 🔌 Hands-on Experience
This **hands-on practical** lab session equipped me with basic knowledge of how a PC is put together and why each part matters. It helped turn abstract concepts into real experience that I can build on in future projects.
