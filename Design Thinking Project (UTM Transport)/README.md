## 📝 Reflection

### 🛡️ Vision for a Secure Future
Through this journey, I have solidified my goal to not just learn Computer Science, but to master the essential knowledge required to become a professional Cybersecurity expert. I realized that my role isn't just about managing systems; it is about protecting people. I want to contribute to building a secure online environment where users can navigate the digital world safely, without fear of their data or privacy being compromised.

### ❤️ Innovation Starts with Empathy
This project taught me that Design Thinking is much more than a problem-solving framework—it is about empathy. It pushed me to look closer at the people around me, to genuinely care about their daily struggles, and to identify the "pain points" society often ignores. I learned that once we truly understand these issues, Computer Science becomes a powerful tool. We can use our technical skills to craft solutions that don't just work in code, but actually address the real-life challenges faced by our community.

### 🌱 Building a Strong Foundation
Since Computer Science is such a rapidly evolving field, I realized the importance of pacing myself. My strategy is to focus deeply during lectures to build a strong theoretical foundation first. From there, I plan to bridge the gap between theory and practice by exploring beginner-level projects. I believe that strengthening my practical skills step-by-step is the best way to stay relevant and effective in this fast-moving industry.
