## 📝 Reflection

### 💡 Bridging Theory and Practice
From this industrial talk, I understood that computer science is a field that requires a strong foundation of knowledge as well as the critical ability to apply that knowledge to real problem-solving situations. The speaker, **Mr. Alim**, shared his personal experience and emphasised his struggles during his first three years of working, where he found it difficult to implement what he had learned academically into a real working environment. This example clearly highlighted the gap that can exist between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

### 🚀 The Importance of Agile & Management
In addition, the talk helped me realise that **project management** and **system development** skills are extremely important in computer science. Most computer science projects involve teamwork, which requires effective working methods. Approaches such as **Agile** are essential to ensure proper planning, smooth implementation, and efficient development throughout a project. Good collaboration and structured workflows play a significant role in the success of team-based projects.

### 🤖 AI as an Assisting Tool
Lastly, with the advancement of artificial intelligence, the speaker reminded us that we should not fully rely on **AI** to complete our tasks. Instead, AI should be treated as an **assisting tool** that helps improve efficiency. When using AI, it is important for us to have a clear understanding of what we are doing. We must provide AI with a well-structured task and clear direction, while AI’s role is mainly to speed up tedious and heavy processes within a project, rather than replacing our own thinking and understanding.
