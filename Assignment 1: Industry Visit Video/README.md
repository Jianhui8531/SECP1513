## 📝 Reflection
I’m really pleased I got to visit UTM Digital — the IT department at UTM. Seeing how the theories from our textbooks come to life in day-to-day work made a big difference for me. It was one thing to learn concepts in class, but watching real systems being planned, built and maintained showed me how those ideas actually fit together. I felt honoured to meet and interview staff there. Their stories and practical advice inspired me and gave me a clearer sense of which direction I want my career to take. After the talks and conversations, I’m much more certain about what I should focus on during my studies: the skills to sharpen, the gaps to close, and the habits to build before entering the industry. Overall the visit left me motivated and excited — I want more opportunities like this to broaden my horizons and help me turn classroom learning into real-world ability
