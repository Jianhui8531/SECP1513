# 🚢 Assignment 4: Industrial Visit 2 -- Johor Port Berhad (Newsletter)

## 📖 Overview
On 8 January 2026, my groupmates and I had the opportunity to visit Johor Port Berhad. From there, we got to know more about how ICT works in a real-life industry and how a big company operates and manages well with the assistance of ICT. After that, we made a newsletter regarding the visit to document our findings.

## 📝 Reflection

### 💡 Learning Beyond the Classroom
Visiting Johor Port Berhad was a refreshing change from our usual lecture halls. It was inspiring to watch Mr. Taufik and his team manage what they described as an "adventurous" work environment. They have to balance the high pressure of daily logistics with the excitement of trying new strategies. Instead of just learning theory, we saw with our own eyes that being adaptable is the most important skill for solving real-world problems that textbooks don't always cover.

### 🚀 A Real Opportunity
The part that really stood out to me was how welcoming the department was to us. Knowing they have over 20 projects ready for student input turned this from a normal visit into a real career opportunity. It changed my mindset from just being an observer to realising I could actually contribute to important industry projects right now.

### 🛠️ Technology as a Silent Partner
This visit opened my eyes to what innovation really does. I learned that it is mainly about making work easier and safer for the people doing it. It was interesting to see them use "low-code" platforms, not just to follow a trend, but to build helpful tools quickly so staff don't have to wait forever for solutions. I realised that the best technology works like a "silent partner," taking care of the boring, repeated tasks so the human workforce can operate with less stress and more efficiency.
