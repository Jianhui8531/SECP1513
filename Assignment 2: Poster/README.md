## 📝 Reflection
The PPG Digital talk gave me valuable insight into how IT functions in a global company. Seeing how data analytics, cloud systems and SAP are applied to solve real business problems helped me connect what I learn in class with actual industry practices. Talking to the speakers and staff made me realise that textbook knowledge alone is not enough, and that I need to develop stronger practical and communication skills. The internship-to-hire pathway and emphasis on mentorship really motivated me. This experience encouraged me to focus more on hands-on projects, teamwork and gaining real industry exposure before graduating.
